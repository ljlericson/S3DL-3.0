# S3DL-3.0

This is yet another remake of s3dl, I'm hoping to write clean and efficient code that doesn't get overcomplicated like s3dl 2.0. I am going to use a build system like cmake with this project and also use different naming conventions as something new to do.

### How To Build
Please note this is a windows only project. 
1. Go into the vcpkg directory, open a command prompt and run:
`vcpkg install`
2. Run "generate.bat"
3. Go into the new build folder and double click the `s3glr.sln` file to open VS 2022.
